grocery_bomb
============

a simple grocery list on Rails 4.0 loaded with Jasmine

I built the app before testing. Once I started adding Jasmine tests I realized that OOJS organization could have been built with less dependencies.  I couldn't fully test the GroceryList without an Item which was maybe an uneccesary class to define.
It would be nice to integrate the models with JS objects.
